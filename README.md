# Neural Network Implementations

This repository contains different implementations of neural network optimization and development workflows, each in its own branch.

## Branches

### `mnist-optimization`
MNIST digit classification using PyTorch with Optuna for hyperparameter optimization and MLflow for experiment tracking. Demonstrates automated model architecture search and comprehensive visualization tools.

### `ml-app-dev`
A machine learning application development workflow showcasing model deployment, API integration, and production-ready practices.

### `jupyter-nn-training`
Neural network training implementation using Jupyter notebooks within Docker containers. Focuses on interactive development and experimentation.

## Usage

Switch to the desired branch to view its specific implementation:
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
